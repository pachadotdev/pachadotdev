# About me

ðŸ‘‹ I am a statistician interested in applying statistical methods to address specific policy-relevant questions, particularly in international trade, migration, investments and theoretically founded empirical work.

My top educational project is the ðŸ“– R for Data Science translation into [Spanish](https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/), where I also had to organize the community involved in the translation. This project also features [solutions](https://r4ds-soluciones.netlify.app) in Spanish.

My top cloud infrastructure project is DigitalOcean's [RStudio Server](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/rstudio) image, which provides a fully working R + Tidyverse setup in less than 1 minute.

# R and Shiny training

I offer short courses for groups and individual personalized sessions at [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pacha/extras). I am certified to teach the Tidyverse and Shiny by [RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers).

To contact me, send me an email to mavargas*11* ðŸ“« uc.cl. I can provide my CV (academic/profesional) upon request.

## CRAN

I maintain the [WebTechnologies](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html) view and the official mirror for [Chile](https://cran.dcc.uchile.cl).

## LaTeX

I created the R package [varsityblues](https://github.com/pachadotdev/varsityblues), which allow you to write your own reports including R code and handles LaTeX setup automatically. This package is based on the LaTeX style files that that late professor Kim C. Border once sent to me.

## Cloud computing

I created images for [RStudio Server](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/rstudio) and [RStudio Server + Kubernetes](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/rstudio-kubernetes), which allow you to create virtual machines on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/1d5a471e5f54) and to skip the setup time to install the Tidyverse and other packages. With these images, it takes around 30 seconds to have a ready to go setup for Data Science. This combines well with [analogsea](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=analogsea) as I explain in my [blog](https://pacha.dev/blog/2021/07/17/analogsea-using-arrow-s3-and-digitalocean-for-efficient-model-fitting-in-rstudio/).

## Datasets

Check [SQL Databases for students and educators](https://databases.pacha.dev/) if you need access to PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server databases (in strict descending order of preference!).

I also maintain [Open Trade Statistics](https://tradestatistics.io), a project created with the intention to lower the barrier to working with international economic trade data. It includes a public API, a dashboard, and an R package for data retrieval.
